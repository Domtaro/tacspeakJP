## Basic version

The model files required to use Tacspeak are included in, and can be downloaded from, Tacspeak releases [jwebmeister/tacspeak](https://github.com/jwebmeister/tacspeak/releases).

Just download the .zip of the model, extract the `kaldi_model` folder (and files) into the folder containing `Tacspeak.exe` (or cli.py).

Alternatively, models can be downloaded from my fork of Kaldi Active Grammar releases [jwebmeister/kaldi-active-grammar](https://github.com/jwebmeister/kaldi-active-grammar/releases), or the original Kaldi Active Grammar releases [daanzu/kaldi-active-grammar](https://github.com/daanzu/kaldi-active-grammar/releases).  These alternative models are not guaranteed to work correctly (or as accurately) with Tacspeak.
